                    <p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science working with compiler infrastructures such as  <a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank">LLVM</a>, Machine Learning Modelling, Integer Linear/Quadratic Programming and Simulators for Domain Specific System-on-Chip design under the supervision of <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/" target="_blank">Prof. David Brooks</a>. One key characteristic I'm interested in while designing these systems is the potential to approximate operations for specific application domains such as Robotics and Machine Learning. With the end/slowdown of Moore's law there is a lot of focus on finding non-conventional computing paradigms and in my research I'm working on merged dataflow accelerators as well as architectures robust to approximate computations.</p>

                <p class="margin-bot">Extending state of the art runtime systems to allow the application to make a disciplined use of the hardware by learning from the execution history. For example, we have
                    performed extensive research on the concept of Approximate Task Memoization (ATM) which
                    allows to reuse the results of previous computations at slight costs of application correctness. In
                    this kind of research, performance analysis also proves to be very useful to enable the runtime to
                    optimize the most common application patterns. ATM for example relies on extensive studies
                    using performance analysis tools. This is the work we have managed to successfully publish in
                    the current IPDPS17 conference.

		The next step was to create hardware support for the approximate task memoization. For example we've identified hashing and the memoization table management as the key overheads in performing coarse grained memoization and the hardware helped speed up many of the applications with aggressive value reuse.</p>

                <p>Research on Medium Grained Parallelism discovery. Medium grained parallelism includes granularities from Tasks as in "Task Based Programming Models" and larger granularities than instruction level parallelism(ILP).</p>
                <p>This is motivated by the need of leveraging all possible sources of parallelism to exploit the concurrency available in current and future hardware substrates. While many approaches have looked at exploiting loop-level parallelism using different techniques (e.g. thread-level speculation), not much material is available on the limits of parallelisation at coarser granularities.</p>
                <p class="margin-bot">The first use case for the analysis tools has been simulating the scenario where functions can be invoked asynchronously, and we studied the impact of syscalls and external library calls on the available parallelism (with limited support for data dependency tracking).</p>
