I've been wanting to create a blog for a long time to share every-day cool hacks or interesting math facts I come accross.

First I just want to encourage anyone who has a github and who is willing to write a blog (like this one) to go ahead and try. It's at most a 30 minutes job. 

There is no code for me to report at this time I'll leave this here for later:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
